# pizza-order-system-Cpp
A simple pizza order system / OOP with C++

## assignment description

> It is now your task to develop a system for printing receipts for a pizza order. The orders that can be done at the restaurant are luckily quite simple. It is only possible to order two types of products, namely: softdrinks or pizza. For softdrinks the employee has to enter the price per can and the number of cans to calculate the total price. For pizzas calculating the price is a bit more difficult. Because a lot of different pizzas can be ordered, together with the restaurant it has been decided the employee will fill out the list of ingredients and price per ingredient for every pizza. From the list of ingredients the item price of the pizza can now be calculated. 
The system does not have to store a database of all possible softdrinks and pizzas, nor does it have to store a database of all possible ingredients. The employee will fill out per pizza which ingredients are on the pizza. Printing of the receipt can be done by writing to std::cout. 


> Please note: You don’t have to make a menu or other user interfaces for the system.


## Example outout

Output of the system looks like this:
```text
